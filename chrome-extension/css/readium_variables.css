/**
 * Within this file all sass variables to the Readium Project are defined
 */
/**
 * Dependent on the location of the calling html file (e. g. viewer.html) the 
 * file hirarchy may be broken and images are out of range. Also relative 
 * paths may be preferred to absolute ones. All this can be done with this 
 * preceding path. As images start from document root with the naming of 
 * their folder, the path in the path variable should end with a "/".
 * 
 * Affected sass files:
 *   readium_paginator
 *   toc
 *   viewer_settings_modal
 *
