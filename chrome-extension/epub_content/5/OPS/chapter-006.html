            <p>So soon as I'd milked, Gideon being still hard at it in the meadow, I went upstairs and put on my black, and my mob-cap. I never wore it to work in, to save washing, and folk thought I was a heathen, pretty near, what with no mob-cap and no shoes or stockings most of the time, but bare feet or clogs. Gideon could whittle a clog right well, and they be grand for doing mucky work like I did. I'd made me a sacking gown, too, short to the knee, for cleaning the beast-housen in. I know everybody called me the barn-door savage of Sarn. But when I remembered the beautiful house at Lullingford that was to be, and the flowered gowns and dimity curtains and china, I didna take it to heart much.</p>
            <p>I was very choice of my homespun gown with the crossover, and the new mob-cap trimmed with little sausages made of sarsnet, very new-fangled. So I did my hair in ringlets &#8212; one on each side and two at the back, down to my waist.</p>
            <p>I was comfortable in my mind, thinking how we were going to send away for simples to make me as beautiful as a fairy. While I milked I thought about it, and while I cleaned the sties, and while I scrubbed the kitchen quarries.</p>
            <p>Mother winnocked a bit, to hear I was off to Plash, for she was low and melancholy from abiding under the shadow of death. She'd been so used to humouring a tempersome man that she felt as restless as you do when you've just cast off the second stocking-toe of a pair.</p>
            <p>She'd sit quiet a bit in the chimney corner, and you'd hear the wheel whirring softly, like a little lych-fowl. Then suddenly she'd give over spinning, and wring her hands, that always made me think of a mole's little hands, lifted up to God when it be trapped. And she'd say, 'Sunday was a week, he had no bacon to his tea! Sunday was a fornit, he didna like the dumplings, and no wonder, for they were terrible sad, Prue. Twice I o'er-boiled his eggs in that last week, and the new smock, Prue &#8212;'</p>
            <p>At that, she'd cry a long while.</p>
            <p>'I hivered and hovered over it, Prue, so he died afore it was done. Oh, my dear, to think on it! It wanted but the shoulder pieces and the cuffs, and it would ha' been the best smock ever I made. But I hivered and hovered, and he couldna bide any longer. He heard the mighty voice, child, calling among the ellums out yonder, and he couldna tarry for his smock, poor soul. All my stitches for naught.'</p>
            <p>'Now, Mother, you mun finish it for Gideon,' I said. 'It'll fit Gideon right well, for he's a fine big man, though not so broad as Father. But he'll fill out. Come his eighteenth birthday, I shouldna wonder but he'll look right well in it. So you'd best hurry up.'</p>
            <p>'Well,' she said, 'well, there's sense in that, child. He took the sin, to wear all his life long. He shall have the smock.'</p>
            <p>She fetched Gideon's Sunday coat, and took the smock out of the dresser drawer, to measure it.</p>
            <p>I sent up a wish that they might be enough of a size to content her. And so they were, and she quieted down again, and set off once more, whirring like a little lych-fowl.</p>
            <p>But it wunna for long. She gave me a look, time and again, while I was putting on me mittens, and said &#8212;</p>
            <p>'The ringlets be right nice, Prue.' And then: 'You've got a very tidy figure, child.'</p>
            <p>And all in a minute she bent two-double over the wheel and began the old weariful cry &#8212;</p>
            <p>'Could I help it if the hare crossed my path: could I help it?'</p>
            <p>'Oh, Mother, Mother!' I beseeched her, 'give over crying for what we canna mend. I canna bear to hear you cry, my dear. Mother! Look ye! I dinna mind at all. There, there now, my lamb!' (I was used to call her that, because she seemed so little and so lost). 'There, dunna take it to heart. Listen what I'll tell you! <em>I'd as like have</em> a <em>hare-shotten lip as not!'</em> With that, I ran out of the house and through the wicket and up the wood path, roaring-crying.</p>
            <p>I cried so loud that there was a whirr of wings on this side and on that, and far up the glade a coney heard me, and sat up in the middle of the path like a Christian, with one paw held up, just as Parson does, giving the blessing. Only it was a curse that his cousin, the hare, gave me.</p>
            <p>I wondered why it cursed me so. Was it of its own free will and wish, or did the devil drive it? Did God begrutch me an 'usband and a cot of rushes, that He's let it be so? In the years after, it did often seem a queer thing that I should be obliged to work weekdays and Sundays so as to earn enough money to put straight what a silly hare had put crooked. And I knew it would take a deal of money to cure a hare-shotten lip. There was a kind of sour laughter in the thought of it. It called to mind the blackish autumn evenings, when grouse rise from the bitter marsh and fly betwixt the withered heather and the freezing sky, and laugh. Old harsh men laugh that way at the falling down of an enemy. And the good ladies of the town, big with stiff flowered silks and babes righteously begotten, laughed so behind their fans when they went to the prison to see a lovely harlot whipped. With that kind of bitterness a man might laugh when he was dying of a wound gotten in the king's cause, and one came busily in while the Parson was reading the prayer for the dying, and cried out, 'The king doth give you an earldom, and send you a bidding letter to his palace.'</p>
            <p>Ah! Those be the ways grouse laugh, and that was how I laughed in those days. But now I sit here between the hearth and the window, with the tea brewing for one that will be home afore sundown, and the clouds standing upon the mountains, and when I laugh, I laugh easy, like the woodpecker in spring. He was ever a laugher, was the woodpecker, and a right merry laugher too. He'll fly into an ellum tree, and laugh to see it so green. And he'll fly into an ash, and laugh to see it so bare, with only the black buds and no leaves. And then he'll fly into an oak, and laugh fit to burst to see the young brown leaves. Ah, the woodpecker's a good laugher, and the laughter's sweet as a sound nut. If we can laugh so at the end of long living, we've not lived in vain.</p>
            <p>But that evening I laughed like the grouse, and my heart was rebellious within me.</p>
            <p>Yet I could not but be pleased to think of the writing. I was glad also because it would give me a hold over Gideon, since if he was too harsh with Mother and me, I could be a bit awkward about the writing. I ran along by the water, feeling light and easy in my best sandal shoes, thinking how I'd work to get the stuff that was to make me as beautiful as a fairy, and how in a while there'd come a lover, and the axings would be put up in church, and in another while I'd sit in my own houseplace with my foot on a rocker and with a babe, grand and solemn, on my knee, better than all the French wax dolls they told of, that I'd never seen, but wanted very bad.</p>
            <p>I was contented to see the coots swimming about with a trail of coot chickens after them, for all the world as if they were on a string. And I laughed to see the heron that lived on the far side of the water, and had got a missus and a nest there, standing knee-deep among the lilies, fair comic-struck. In after days I saw Gideon look like that, time and again, when he'd lief talk to Jancis and couldna call to mind a single word, or when he'd put his best cravat on and couldna get it to his liking, looking in the glass that he bought out of his second wool money, after he'd seen Jancis under the rosy light.</p>
            <p>I met Jancis afore I got to the Stone House. She was bringing the oxen in, because they were ordered for a fair and the people were coming for 'em early in the morning. Betwixt the two white beasts, with a hand on each, with all that gold hair shining, and a face like a white rose, she looked like the ghost of a beautiful lady that died a long while ago and came again every midsummer and fled at cockcrow.</p>
            <p>'Oh!' she said, 'you've gotten ringlets, Prue. Shall I have ringlets for Sarn Wake?'</p>
            <p>'As you please,' I answered, very snappy. For she was pretty enough without ringlets, and her mouth more a rose than ever. I thought how rich the ringlets would look, hanging down like ripe yellow bunches of white currants when they be traced very thick on the boughs, and she saying 'O!' and the fellows wanting to kiss her.</p>
            <p>When she'd fastened the beasts in the trevis, we went indoors. 'Mister Beguildy!' I called out, 'I want you to learn me to read and write and sum, and all you know. I'm to pay in work. Gideon and me's going to get rich, and buy a place in Lullingford, and have maids and men, and flowered gowns for me, and china &#8212;'</p>
            <p>Beguildy looked at me over the rim of a great measure of mead. 'Saddle your dreams afore you ride 'em, my wench,' he said.</p>
            <p>'How mean you, Mister Beguildy?'</p>
            <p>'The answer's under your mob-cap,' says he. 'If I be to learn ye, there's to be no argling, no questions and no answers. I say the saying, but you mun find the meaning. Now you come back to me a week to-day and tell me what I meant, and then for a bit of a treat I'll show you the bottle with the old Squire in it, old Camperdine, great-grandad to this un, him as came again so bad every Harvest Home, and sang a roaring bawdy song somewhere up in the chance!, only none could see un, so none could catch un.'</p>
            <p>'Saving you.'</p>
            <p>Beguildy smiled. He'd got a very slow stealing smile, that came like a ripple on the water, and stayed a long while.</p>
            <p>'Ah. Saving me. I caught un proper.'</p>
            <p>'What way did you?'</p>
            <p>'If I told you, Prue Sarn, you'd know as much as me.'</p>
            <p>'But so tell how you got him into the bottle!'</p>
            <p>'Dear to goodness! You've forgotten the bargain. No questions.' He picked up the hammer and beat upon the row of flints, making out a little tune. And with that, in came Missis Beguildy, like the dancing woman at the fair comes in when they sound the drum. She'd got a basket of trout and a couple of fowl she was going to dress for the Wake the oxen were going to. She'd got on an old bottle-green hat of Beguildy's, tall in the crown, such as gentlemen of the road were partial to then, and it looked very outlandish atop of her frizzy grey hair.</p>
            <p>'Did you hear tell?' she said to me.</p>
            <p>She'd got a deep, solemn voice, and as she was too busy to speak often, everything she said seemed very weighty, as if the Town Crier said it, standing on the steps of the market in his braided coat.</p>
            <p>'I heard as the Devil was dead,' said Beguildy, 'but it inna true, for I met un yestreen, and very pleasant spoken he was indeed, and right pleased to have your Feyther's company, Prue.'</p>
            <p>'Now hush your gabble,' said Missis Beguildy, pulling the feathers out of the fowl in handfuls, so that the room was like a snowstorm. 'Did you hear tell, Prue, as poor John Weaver strayed off the road going through the woods in the dark of the moon last night, and was drownded in Blackmere? Death's very catching, poor soul.'</p>
            <p>'Why it wanted but an hour to dawn when he left,' I said.</p>
            <p>'Time enow, time enow. It's dark as Egypt in the woods down yonder.'</p>
            <p>'Who'll take his place?'</p>
            <p>'They seyn there's a nephew learning the trade. But he's bound 'prentice for a year or two. They'll make shift with a hired mon, I reckon.'</p>
            <p>'And it ud be better, a power,' burst out Missis Beguildy, 'if <em>you</em> took that sort of job.'</p>
            <p>She took the poker from the fire and singed the fowl very shrewdly, as if it met have been Beguildy.</p>
            <p>'Woman, I've better things to think on than weaving weeds to cover the poor dying body. Dunna I snare souls like conies, and keep 'em from troubling the lives of men? Canna I bless, and they are blessed, curse, and they are cursed? Canna I cure warts and the chin-cough and barrenness and the rheumatics, and tell the future and find water, though it be in the depth of the earth? Dunna the fowls I bless beat all the other fowls in the cock-fighting? Ah, and if I chose, I could make a waxen man for every man in the parish, and consume them away, wax, men, and all. Canna I do all that, woman?'</p>
            <p>'So you say, my dear.'</p>
            <p>Missis Beguildy set the fowl's legs to rights and ran a skewer through, to make all safe.</p>
            <p>Seeing that the Wizard was becoming very angry, I told his missus how I was going to be his scholar, and he was to learn me to spell and write.</p>
            <p>'Will your headpiece stand it, child?' she asked. For she always thought, in common with many people, that if there was anything wrong with a person's outward seeming, there must be summat wrong with their mind as well. By that measure, Jancis, who was so silly that oftentimes she appeared to be well-nigh simple, would be a very clever woman.</p>
            <p>'Ah. Prue's headpiece be right enow,' said Beguildy. 'Only I do think there be too many questions in it. But her'll fettle into a good scholar, will Prue. We'll start to-day's a week, Prue. Jancis, you can get the besom and sweep out my room a bit. Put the tuthree books together, gather me some quills, and be very careful of all my bottles, for you never know who's in 'em. We dunna want any frittening about the place. Oh, and you met as well turn them toads out from behind the locker; they be all dead.'</p>
            <p>'Prue,' says Jancis, when I went out, 'if yo'll tell me the way to make ringlets like that, I'll tell you what Feyther's old riddle-me-ree means. I know, because he's said it over and over, and I've heard un tell the answer.'</p>
            <p>'I made 'em round and round the poker, my dear,' I said. 'Not too hot, and give it a good clean first. But you needna tell me the answer to the riddle-me-ree, for I'd liefer find it out.'</p>
            <p>The dew came showering on to my gown as I went past the bushes of wild roses at the wood gate, spilling out of the hearts of the blossoms. It was so quiet that I could hear the sheep cropping across the corner of the mere in the glebe, and the fish rising out in the middle, and the water lapping against the big, stiff leaves of the bulrushes.</p>
            <p>I felt like a lady, walking out in my best on a weekday. It wasna often that I could be spared, and it was to be a deal less often now. So I was glad Gideon wanted me to be a scholar, for once every week I should get the afternoon and evening off.</p>
            <p>When a breeze came, the leaves lapped up the silence like the tongues of little creatures drinking. Up in heaven there were clouds like the bit of lace on Mother's wedding-gown, and a setting moon as green as a young beech leaf. And down under the polished water was another moon, not quite so bright, and other clouds, not quite so lacy, and the shadow of the spire, very faint and ghostly, pointing across the water at us.</p>
